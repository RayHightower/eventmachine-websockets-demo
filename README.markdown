Sinatra and Websockets
===

Purpose: To see if we can make websockets work in a very light-weight Ruby/Sinatra app.

Based on the [eventmachine-websockets-demo](https://github.com/stewart/eventmachine-websockets-demo) repo created by the team at [Hybrid Group](http://hybridgroup.com).

Details on the thinking behind this repo are posted on the [Engine Yard Blog](https://blog.engineyard.com/2013/getting-started-with-ruby-and-websockets).
